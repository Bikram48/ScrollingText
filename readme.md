Scrolling Text
==========================
## Task 3

#### This is how I finished task 3.
<p> In task2 scrollable viewgroup was implemented which can holds only one child view. <br>
So, to hold more than two child view I create a new viewgroup called linearlayout inside the scrollview and <br>
placed all the view elements in it.  </p>
